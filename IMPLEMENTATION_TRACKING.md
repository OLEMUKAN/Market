## Project Completion
The AgriMarket Uganda MVP application has been successfully implemented with all core functionalities as specified in the implementation plan:

1. **User Authentication**: Users can register and log in securely using Firebase Authentication.

2. **Commodity Price Information Display**: Users can view a list of agricultural commodities with their images and average market prices. They can tap on a commodity to see detailed price breakdown by district.

3. **Modern UI/UX**: The app features a modern Material Design UI with custom colors, typography, animations, and responsive layouts.

4. **Security**: Proper Firestore security rules ensure that only authenticated users can access data and users can only modify their own data.

All core requirements from the implementation plan have been met, and the app has been tested to ensure it functions correctly.

## Next Steps
- Conduct user testing with actual users
- Consider adding offline caching for commodity data
- Implement push notifications for price updates
- Add user profile management features
- Expand to more commodities and districts
