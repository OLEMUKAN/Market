Based on the revised, requirement-focused implementation plan, the AgriMarket Uganda MVP application will have the following functionalities for the end-user:

I. User Authentication & Access:

Secure Login and registration: Users can log in to the application using their email address and a password.

(Relates to: Firebase Authentication, Login Screen)

Input Validation: The login form will provide basic validation for email and password fields (e.g., checking if they are filled).

(Relates to: User input handling)

Feedback on Login Attempt: Users will see visual feedback during the login process (e.g., a loading indicator) and clear error messages if login fails (e.g., "Invalid credentials," "User not found").

(Relates to: State management, User input handling)

Authenticated Access to Data: Only users who have successfully logged in will be able to view the commodity price information.

(Relates to: Navigation logic, Firestore security rules)

II. Commodity Price Information & Discovery:

View Commodity List (Home Screen): After logging in, users will see a scrollable list of agricultural commodities.

This list will display at least five items.

(Relates to: HomeScreen, LazyColumn, Firestore data fetching)

Information per Commodity in List: Each item in the commodity list will display:

The name of the commodity.

An image representing the commodity (for at least three items in the list). Images will have rounded corners.

The average market price for that commodity (calculated across available districts).

(Relates to: CommodityCard, Data Model, UI Components)

View Detailed Commodity Information (Detail Screen): Users can tap on any commodity in the list to navigate to a dedicated detail screen for that specific commodity.

(Relates to: Navigation, User input handling - gestures)

Detailed Price Breakdown: The Detail Screen will show:

The name of the selected commodity.

An image of the commodity.

A breakdown of prices by district (initially 7 districts):

District Name

Farm Gate Price (FGP) for that commodity in that district.

Market Price (MP) for that commodity in that district.

(Relates to: DetailScreen, Data Model, Firestore data fetching)

III. User Interface & Experience:

Consistent Visual Design: The app will have a unified look and feel across all screens.

Custom App Icon: A unique icon for the app on the device.

Material Theming: Utilizes a custom color scheme (primary, secondary, background), custom (non-default) fonts, and defined shapes (e.g., rounded corners for cards and images).

App Bar: A consistent top app bar for navigation (e.g., screen titles, back button) and branding.

(Relates to: Theming requirements)

Multi-Screen Navigation: Users can smoothly navigate between different screens (Login, Home, Detail).

(Relates to: Navigation Compose)

Interactive Elements & Feedback:

Clickable components (buttons, list items) will provide visual feedback (e.g., ripple effect).

At least one animation will be implemented (e.g., fade-in of list items).

(Relates to: Interactive Elements requirements)

Responsive to Device Changes: The app will handle configuration changes like screen rotation without losing user data or the current state (e.g., scroll position, entered text before submission).

(Relates to: ViewModel, State management)

Functionalities derived from the Problem Statement & Use Case:

Access to Market Price Information: The core functionality allows users (farmers, traders, etc.) to access agricultural commodity prices.

Enhanced Market Transparency: By providing structured price data, the app aims to improve transparency.

Informed Decision-Making: The provided FGP and MP data across districts helps users make better selling/buying decisions.


This set of functionalities directly addresses the MVP goals and the specified project requirements, ensuring a focused and deliverable application.
